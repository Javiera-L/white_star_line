## Project Description
The project addresses the hypothetical need (and more from historical paranoia than anything else) for shipping companies to send out iceberg-towing tugs with all their ships. In order to use these iceberg-towing tugs, the companies need an application that can locate icebergs and assess their towability. This is the aim of this project.

The application I have built uses satellite radar data, and airborn lidar (LIght Detection and Ranging) data from an area of sea to locate the icebergs. With this information we can both locate the icebergs and approximate their mass. The functionality of the app is as follows:

1. Identifies the individual icebergs and their locations.
2. Calculates the mass of each iceberg.
3. Outputs the total mass, the total volume and whether you can pull the berg on the GUI, with option to save data to file.
