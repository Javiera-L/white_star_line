## Project Description
["Imagine that you are working for the White Star Line shipping company and you want, more from historical paranoia than any real need, to send out an iceberg-towing tug with all your ships. You need an application to find icebergs and assess their tow-ability."] (https://www.geog.leeds.ac.uk/courses/computing/study/core-python-phd/assessment2/ice.html)

The aim of this project is to build a programme that can read radar and lidar data and use it to identify icebergs and whether or not they are towable.
